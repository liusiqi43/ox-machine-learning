# Practical 4
Machine Learning, Hilary Term 2016, Week 6

## Setup
In addition to the setup, we've been using so far, you'll need to install the svm package. Please refer to the [practical 1 repository](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2016/practical1), and run the script as instructed to make sure you have the standard setup. Then run 
```
bash practical4.sh.
```
This will install the torch-svm package. This will also download the dataset and place it in a directory practical4-data. Make sure this directory is in the contained in the location where you have your lua files.

## Materials

We'll be classifying handwritten digits in a dataset called MNIST, which look like the following:

![mnist](https://github.com/oxford-cs-ml-2016/practical3/raw/master/mnist.png)

See `practical4.lua`. The file provides a function to load the data and a function that you should complete to perform grid search.
